# üìä Automobile Sales Statistics Dashboard

This project is a dynamic, interactive dashboard built using **Dash** and **Plotly** to visualize and analyze historical automobile sales data, focusing on trends during and outside of recession periods.

-----

## üí° Project Overview and Scenario

 The objective of this dashboard is to analyze the historical trends in automobile sales to provide insights into how the sales of **XYZAutomotives** were affected during times of recession[  28, 29].  The analysis covers the years **1980 to 2013**.

 The dashboard is structured to display two primary reports, controlled by an interactive dropdown menu: **Yearly Automobile Sales Statistics** and **Recession Period Statistics**

-----

## ‚ú® Features and Interactivity

The dashboard utilizes two main interactive components to allow users to explore the data:

1.  **Report Type Selection:** A dropdown allows the user to choose between the two main reports:
      * `Yearly Statistics`
      *  `Recession Period Statistics`
2.   **Year Selection:** A second dropdown is used to select a specific year.
      *  This dropdown is **enabled** when `Yearly Statistics` is selected.
      *  It is **disabled** when `Recession Period Statistics` is selected, as the recession report covers multiple years.

 Both reports display four distinct plots in a 2-row, 2-column layout.
